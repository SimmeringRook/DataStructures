# DataStructures

As a learning exercise, I am recreating each data structure. My hope is to better understand their implementations across various languages and their differences.

### Planned Implementations:
- Stacks
- Lists
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs

### Planned Languages:
1. C# (including LINQ compatibility)
2. C++
3. Python
