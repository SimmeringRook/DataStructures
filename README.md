# DataStructures

As a learning exercise, I am recreating each data structure. My hope is to better understand their implementations across various languages and their differences.

###Planned Implementations:
-Stacks
-Lists
-Queues
-Trees
-Graphs

###Planned Languages:
-C# (including LINQ compatibility)
-C++
-Python
